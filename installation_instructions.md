# The ContentMine virtual machine

Before the workshop, all attendees should do the following (instructions below):

1. Download and install the VirtualBox
2. Download and install the ContentMine virtual machine image

## 1. Getting VirtualBox

Please download the VirtualBox platform installer for your operating system from the [VirtualBox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

## 2. Getting the ContentMine VM image

Requirements:
* 64-bit architecture (unless otherwise stated)
* 3 GB RAM
* Adequate hard drive space for the VM (at least 5 GB)

Please download the `direct link` for the virtual image corresponding to the relevant workshop from the list [here](README.md#List of available machines). This should be a `.ova` file. Note, this is a large file ~1.2GB, please be patient while it downloads. Depending on your connection that can take between 10 and 60 minutes.

When the file has downloaded, double-clicking it should open VirtualBox and offer to import the virtual machine. Please follow the on-screen instructions to complete the import.

When this is done, you're ready to start [exploring the VM](using_contentmine_vm.md)!

### Troubleshooting

If you have any problems getting VirtualBox, or downloading and importing the virtual image, don't worry. We will set aside time during workshops to make sure everyone has access to the software.

The most common error is an incomplete image, please verify that the download has been succesfully completed.
