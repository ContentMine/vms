# The ContentMine virtual machine

Before the workshop, all attendees should do the following (instructions below):

1. Download and install the VirtualBox
2. Download and install the ContentMine virtual machine image

## 1. Getting VirtualBox

Please download the VirtualBox platform installer for your operating system from the [VirtualBox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).

Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.

## 2. Getting the ContentMine VM image

Requirements:
* 64-bit architecture (unless otherwise stated)
* 3 GB RAM
* Adequate hard drive space for the VM (at least 5 GB)

Please download the `direct link` for the virtual image corresponding to the relevant workshop from the list [here](README.md#List of available machines). This should be a `.ova` file. Note, this is a large file ~1.2GB, please be patient while it downloads. Depending on your connection that can take between 10 and 60 minutes.

When the file has downloaded, double-clicking it should open VirtualBox and offer to import the virtual machine. Please follow the on-screen instructions to complete the import.

When this is done, you're ready to start [exploring the VM](using_contentmine_vm.md)!

### Troubleshooting

If you have any problems getting VirtualBox, or downloading and importing the virtual image, don't worry. Just contact the workshop organizer before the event and we can help you via email or skype. Please, please try and get these pre-workshop tasks done _before_ arriving at the workshop. There will be little time on the day to help with Virtualbox issues.

The most common error is an incomplete download of the large VM image file, please verify that the download has been succesfully and _fully_ completed.
